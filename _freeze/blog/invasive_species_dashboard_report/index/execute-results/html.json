The purpose of the assignment was to formulate a research question, use R and a relevant dataset to address the question and communicate the analysis into a report and a poster.\n\nI developed an [RShiny Dashboard](https://0uexv8-johann-wagner.shinyapps.io/invasive_species_dashboard/) visualising seven different invasive species by state/territory using ALA data through the [`galah`](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah-R) package with a focus on spatial and temporal visualisations. The dashboard also allows users to download the cleaned dataset for the selected invasive animal species for a particular state/territory.\n\nThe Dashboard is available [here](https://0uexv8-johann-wagner.shinyapps.io/invasive_species_dashboard/).\n\nThe GitHub repository is available [here](https://github.com/johann-wagner/DS4B-final-project/tree/main).\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\n# Data Description\n\nThe data used is from The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), which is \"a collaborative, digital and open infrastructure repository that aggregates biodiversity data from multiple sources\" ([ALA, 2022](https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000261410-introduction-to-the-ala)).\n\nSpecifically, this analysis uses species occurrence records for seven invasive animal species:\n\n1.  [European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/692effa3-b719-495f-a86f-ce89e2981652)\n\n2.  [European Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/2869ce8a-8212-46c2-8327-dfb7fabb8296)\n\n3.  [Cane Toads (Rhinella marina)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e79179f8-44bf-46eb-b139-a2e66f6045c1)\n\n4.  [Feral Cats (Felis catus)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/7de6b16a-f854-4b4b-88cf-81868ce74ad8)\n\n5.  [Feral Horses (Equus (Equus) caballus)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/86b4395d-97a7-470d-b35b-306e01dfbab6)\n\n6.  [Feral Pigs (Sus scrofa)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/948d8ca1-62fc-4d03-a79d-4be2de837264)\n\n7.  [Red Imported Fire Ants (Solenopsis invicta)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/5b3fe1c6-1c2c-4e20-819f-2e6d8fa3d332)\n\nI was interested in the spatial and temporal variables for all 7 species, particularly the longitude and latitude values (`decimalLongitude` and `decimalLatitude`) and date of recording (`eventDate`) for each record.\n\n# Questions/Aims\n\n## Initial Aims:\n\n1.   Develop an RShiny app that showcases the spatial and temporal (monthly) occurrence of ~~the top 5-10~~ 7 invasive animal species in Australia by state/territory ~~and by regionality (urban vs. regional)~~\n\n2.   ~~Visualise and calculate the proportion of the selected invasive animal species observed in an urban area~~\n\n3.   Create a download option for users to download the cleaned dataset for the selected invasive animal species for a particular state/territory\n\n## Justifications:\n\nInitially, I was interested in the spatial distribution of magpies in Canberra as I'm an avid cyclist and wanted to find the hotspots of magpie records and linking/statistically model this data with a collaborative magpie swooping database called [magpiealert.com](https://www.magpiealert.com/). Unfortunately, the data was not available and the sampling bias of the occurrence data may not be truly representative, as observations are more likely to be near roads, airports, and major urban areas ([Kellie, 2022](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2022-07-22_sample-bias/post.html?panelset=mantids)).\n\nThis made me interested in simply visualising the data spatially, instead of using any statistical methodologies and focusing the project on whether there would be major differences/patterns of occurrence records in urban vs. non-urban/regional areas. Unfortunately, given the scope of the project, calculating the urban vs. non-urban analysis would have been too much scope-creep, so this aim was ignored (maybe post-project exploration).\n\nHughes et al. ([2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05926)) and Guerin et al. ([2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144779)) highlight the spatial sampling bias associated with biodiversity data suggesting that these biases must first be understood before applying any statistical modelling methods. Interestingly, Australian research by Piccolo et al. ([2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66719-x)) show that reptile research locations are highly positively correlated with proximity to universities suggesting biodiversity research locations are closely associated by accessibility. Similarly, temporal biases can also influence results, as species distributions can change across time ([Boakes et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000385)).\n\nThe Atlas of Living Australia already have a browser-based spatial visualisation tool, where a specific species can be selected and plotted on a map. However, there seemed to not be a functionality to comparing both the spatial _and_ temporal (by month) variables.\n\nThis dashboard is the initial step in data exploration step and in the essence of open and citizen-science, I wanted to make my cleaned data easily available through the dashboard. Data sharing enables for further analysis and reusability ([Tedersoo et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00981-0), [Ramachandran et al., 2021](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EA001562)). I wanted my dashboard to follow the FAIR Data Principles ([Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)).\n\nI chose invasive animal species, because of the rabbits I see when cycling in Canberra. The other 6 species were chosen arbitrarily based off this [article](https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/news-and-media/media-releases/australia-s-10-worst-invasive-species-study), which summarises the results from Kearney et al.'s paper ([2018](https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/media/qile4abf/kearney-et-al-2018_the-threats-to-aus-species_postprint.pdf)).\n\nA deeper understanding of my thought process is documented in GitHub Issue [`#4`](https://github.com/johann-wagner/DS4B-final-project/issues/4).\n\nThe analysis was based on this [ALA Labs article](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2023-05-16_dingoes/index.html) (Smith et al., 2023).\n\n# Raw data\n\nThe raw data is available using the `galah` package. A user must use an ALA-registered email at [ala.org.au](ala.org.au) and use the `galah_config()` function. Once completed, the custom-function `load_galah_occurrence_data()` was used, where the input argument `species_name` was the aforementioned scientific names of the seven species.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Purpose:\n# To load the occurrence data of any species within the Atlas\n# of Living Australia.\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(galah)\n})\ngalah_config(email = \"johann.wagner@gmail.com\")\n\nload_galah_occurrence_data <- function(\n  # scientific name\n  species_name\n) {\n  species_occurrence <- galah_call() |>\n    \n    # To conduct a search for species scientific name\n    galah_identify(species_name) |>\n    \n    # Pre-applied filter to ensure quality-assured data\n    # the \"ALA\" profile is designed to exclude lower quality records\n    galah_apply_profile(ALA) |> \n    atlas_occurrences(mint_doi = TRUE)\n  \n  return(species_occurrence)\n}\n\n\n\n# References:\n# - [1] https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/692effa3-b719-495f-a86f-ce89e2981652\n# - [2] https://galah.ala.org.au/R/reference/galah_apply_profile.html\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe DOIs for each species:\n\n1.

Similar to R Project environments, the RShiny app is all self-contained in this folder. The individual R scripts in the [*DS4B-final-project/scripts*](https://github.com/johann-wagner/DS4B-final-project/tree/main/scripts) folder must be run first to produce and save the dashboard data within the RShiny folder for most recent data.\n\n### The RShiny App\nThe RShiny folder contains four files:\n\n-   *0-00_setup_and_configuration.R:* loads relevant packages and custom-made functions to create the analysis/visualisations/RShiny.\n\n-   *dashboard_data.csv:* is the cleaned occurrence data for the seven invasive species, including spatial and temporal variables.\n\n-   *server.R* contains the back-end logic/code that takes the two inputs to dynamically create/adjust the visualisations/titles/downloads.\n\n-   *ui.R* contains the front-end user-interface design and layout of the app.\n\n### Spatial Visualisation: European Rabbits in ACT\n\nLet's create the spatial visualisation using European Rabbits and ACT as the inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scales)\nspecies_simple_name <- \"European Rabbits\"\nstate_name <- \"Australian Capital Territory\"\n\n\ndashboard_data <- read_csv(\"processed_data/dashboard_data.csv\")\n\nspatial_data <- dashboard_data %>%\n  filter(\n    simpleName == species_simple_name,\n    state      == state_name\n  )\n\n\n\ncapital_cities_data <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~state,                         ~city,       ~lat,     ~lon,\n  \"Australian Capital Territory\", \"Canberra\",  -35.2809, 149.1300,\n) %>%\n  filter(state == state_name)\n\n\n\nstate2021 %>%\n\n  filter(state_name_2021 == state_name) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n\n  geom_sf(\n    aes(geometry = geometry),\n    fill = \"#E5E4E2\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = spatial_data,\n    aes(\n      x = decimalLongitude,\n      y = decimalLatitude,\n      size = simpleName\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    colour = \"#1b9e77\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = capital_cities_data,\n    aes(\n      x = lon,\n      y = lat,\n      shape = city\n    ),\n    colour = \"#d95f02\",\n    size = 4\n  ) +\n  coord_sf() +\n\n  theme_minimal() +\n\n  # Ref [1]\n  labs(\n    title = bquote(\"There are\" ~\n                     bold(.({\n                       spatial_data %>%\n                         nrow() %>%\n                         comma()\n                     })) ~\n                     \"records:\"),\n    subtitle = bquote(bold(.(\n      species_simple_name\n    )) ~\n      \"in\" ~\n      bold(.(state_name))),\n    shape = \"Capital City\",\n    size = \"Invasive Species\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13),\n\n    # Ref [2]: Improve readability\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_text(\n      size = 12,\n      face = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\",\n    legend.background = element_rect(\n      fill = \"#E5E4E2\",\n      colour = \"#708090\"\n    ),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.justification = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n    legend.box.just = \"right\",\n    legend.margin = margin(6, 6, 6, 6),\n\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = \"transparent\")\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# References:\n# 1: https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2023-05-16_dingoes/post.html\n# 2: https://r-graph-gallery.com/239-custom-layout-legend-ggplot2.html\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nEach green point represents one record. We can see that the majority of records are near Canberra with some patterns in Namadgi National Park, like Boboyan Road. Let's visualise some more maps.\n\n### Temporal Visualisation\n\nThe aim of creating a circular monthly bar plot of record proportions was to explore potential temporal patterns. This plot suggests two things:\n\n1.   The time frequency when citizen scientists submit data and/or when professional/government teams measure/monitor invasive species. Maybe, annual monitoring occurs in May?\n\n2.   The actual temporal species distribution. For example, maybe there are more cats in May in SA, because of reproduction behaviour?\n\nLet's create it for Feral Cats in South Australia (A screenshot was used, see GitHub for code - this blog post is already so long...).\n\n![Temporal Feral Cats in SA](screenshots/temporal_feral_cats_south_australia.png)\n\n## Aim 2: Regionality\n\nThis aim was completely abandoned, because of the scope of the project was getting too big. However, adding the capital city point highlights how majority of the selected species cluster around the capital city. Additionally, a zoom function was added to the Shiny app for users to zoom into specific patterns and areas of interest.\n\n## Aim 3: Data Download\n\nEnsuring the data followed FAIR principles included making the data findable, such as referencing the DOIs on the dashboard. The user can select the two inputs they are interested in and can download the respective csv. The option to download the entire dashboard dataset is also available.\n\n## GitHub Use / Final RShiny App\n\n-   Final UI and visualisation design improvements were made using GitHub Issues to manage these efforts.\n-   GitHub branching was used for each Issue.\n-   GitHub Releases were used to distinguish major developments of the RShiny App.\n\nPlease see the [README](https://github.com/johann-wagner/DS4B-final-project/blob/main/README.md) file for more information.\n\n::: {.column-screen-inset}\n![Invasive Animal Species Dashboard (Version 1.0.0)](screenshots/dashboard_photo.png)\n:::\n\n# References\n\nAtlas of Living Australia website at http://www.ala.org.au.

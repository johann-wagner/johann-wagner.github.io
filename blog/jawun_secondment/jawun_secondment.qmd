It’s Not Basic, It’s Foundational: 
"It’s not basic, it’s foundational." This statement truly summarises my time at the South West Aboriginal Medical Service (SWAMS). My recent six-week Jawun secondment was an experience that has profoundly solidified my belief that relationships, trust, and human skills are absolutely crucial for data professionals.
What is the Jawun Secondment Program?
Jawun is a unique program that partners corporate, government, and not-for-profit organisations with Indigenous communities and organisations across Australia. It’s all about bringing specific skills and expertise to where they’re most needed, to support Indigenous-led initiatives and goals. I had the incredible opportunity to step away from my usual data analysis role and immerse myself in one of these partnerships.
The Immersion: Week 1 – Connecting with Culture
The first week of any Jawun secondment is dedicated to cultural immersion, and honestly, it’s designed to slow things down, be a sponge and soak up all the deep listening. It was a whirlwind of learning, listening, and experiencing - connecting with Country.
We began week 1 at South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council doing some general Jawun induction and learning more about Noongar Boodja Country. More learning continued at the incredible WA Museum Boola Bardip, where the exhibits powerfully articulate the rich history, resilience, and ongoing connection to Country of Noongar people.
We then visited local Indigenous organisations like Derbarl Yerrigan Health Service, Moorditj Koort, and Boola Bidi (Harvey Aboriginal Corporation). Seeing firsthand the incredible work being done on the ground – the holistic approaches to delivering culturally appropriate healthcare and support – was truly inspiring.
Perhaps one of the most profound parts of the immersion was spending two nights camping in swags at Roelands Village, a former Aboriginal mission for Stolen Generation children. Being on that land, hearing the stories shared by Syd Jackson and community members, was very special. It was a stark reminder of resilience, healing, and the ongoing impact of historical, colonial policies.
We also explored the artistic and spiritual dimensions of the region, visiting the breathtaking Wellington Dam mural and experiencing the Ngligi Caves with Koomal Dreaming. These experiences deepened my understanding of traditional bushcraft and respect for Country. Week one wasn't just about absorbing information; it was about truly connecting and building deep respect for the communities we'd be working with.
The Placement: Weeks 2-6 – Working with South West Aboriginal Medical Service
After that intense and invaluable first week, it was time to put our skills to work. I was incredibly fortunate to be placed with the South West Aboriginal Medical Service (SWAMS) in Bunbury. SWAMS is a vital organisation providing holistic health services to Aboriginal people across the Noongar Boodja, and my initial project brief was to help them establish a unified organisational data model.

Deliverables: Building the Foundation
My five weeks with SWAMS were focused on helping them build stronger foundations in their data capabilities. It wasn't about quick fixes; it was about co-designing sustainable solutions that would empower them long after I left. Here’s a rundown of what we managed to achieve together:
Establishing a Data Analytics Service
The cornerstone of my secondment was co-designing the Data Analytics Service Framework. This wasn't just me 'building' a document; it meant countless conversations, deep listening, and iterating with the SWAMS team to ensure it genuinely met their unique needs. The framework defined:
Scope (Why?): What data analytics could and should be done, and crucially, why it mattered for their mission.
Work Plan (What?): A clear roadmap of specific data analytics activities and projects they could undertake.
Service Charter (How?): Guidelines for how the data analytics service would operate, ensuring clarity and consistency.
This framework is a powerful strategic tool. It's helped SWAMS gain immense strategic clarity by defining responsibilities, enabling a shared understanding of data across the organisation, and supporting more sustainable resource allocation. Now, everyone has a clearer picture of who does what, making data work more efficient and impactful.
Enhancing Data Capability
Knowing that building internal capability was key, I ran a series of capability workshops on Reproducible Data Workflows in R. This wasn't just about teaching code; it was about empowering the team to conduct their analysis in a way that is transparent, verifiable, and easily repeatable. We talked about everything from basic R functions to the importance of version control. The 'aha!' moments in these sessions were incredibly rewarding.
Building on the workshops, we also designed a Data Roadmap. This isn't a rigid plan, but more like a compass – a guide for SWAMS to navigate their journey towards better data practices and maturity over time. It helps them prioritise where to focus their efforts.
Finally, I also facilitated conversations with external data professionals – some of my current and previous work colleagues. This was about more than just networking; it was about empowering the SWAMS team by showing them a broader community willing to share knowledge, validating their challenges, and providing insights into how other organisations tackle similar data problems.
Beyond the Technical: Unquantifiable Value
While the deliverables were concrete, some of the most profound impacts of my secondment are harder to put a number on, but are super crucial.
Seeing the empowerment in colleagues as they grasped new concepts or felt supported in their data journey was incredibly rewarding. But none of that would have been possible without actively building relationships and trust. My role wasn't just to deliver; it was to deeply listen, to 'chat chat chat,' and to build that rapport. Trust is the bedrock of everything.
One of the biggest takeaways, for both me and SWAMS, was the realisation that "you’re not alone" in the data struggle. Many organisations, regardless of size or sector, grapple with similar data challenges. And sometimes, the most sophisticated solutions aren't the best. A simple Excel spreadsheet, used effectively, can do wonders and be transformative for an organisation just starting its data journey. This really drove home the idea that 'it’s not basic, it’s foundational' – what might seem simple to me could be revolutionary for them.

Next Steps: Sustaining the Momentum
The secondment might be over, but the work of building strong data foundations at SWAMS continues. We laid the groundwork, and now it’s about nurturing that growth:
Embed & Socialise the Service Framework: This framework needs to become part of SWAMS's daily operations.
Use the Data Roadmap as a compass: Guiding them towards continuous 'better practice.'
Continue learning to implement reproducible workflows: Ensuring ongoing data quality and efficiency.
Formalise Data Management & Governance: Strengthening integrity, security, and compliance.
Champion Data Culture and Data Literacy: Fostering an environment where everyone understands and values data.

What the Secondment Meant to Me: Personal Reflections
Stepping away from the 'what happened' into the 'what it meant' is where the true impact of the Jawun experience lies for me. This secondment wasn't just about delivering projects; it was a profound personal and professional growth journey.
The Unshakeable Power of Relationships & Trust
The co-design process truly highlighted the power of collaboration. My primary job was to listen, to understand their challenges from their perspective, and to build genuine relationships. 'Chat chat chat' was about informal conversations that broke down barriers and fostered trust, which in turn led to easy buy-in for the frameworks and workshops we were introducing. You know you've built effective relationships when leaders like Aneliese and Devin proactively come to you, update you on their achievements, and genuinely rely on your advice. It wasn't just a consultation; it was a true partnership.
Combatting My Imposter Syndrome & Building Self-Confidence
This secondment was a huge personal victory against my own imposter syndrome. In my regular role, surrounded by equally skilled data professionals, it’s easy to feel like you’re just one cog in a very smart machine. But here, in a different context, I realised: "Yes, I do have relevant skills, and I can add significant value. People genuinely value my contributions and my way of thinking." That was a powerful 'aha!' moment.
Shifting Mindsets: From 'Best' to 'Better' Practice
My usual work environment operates at a relatively high level of data maturity. Being at SWAMS gave me invaluable insight into organisations at earlier stages of their data journey, forcing me to re-evaluate what 'good practice' truly means. This experience perfectly illustrated the Dunning-Kruger Effect, not just for the SWAMS team, but for me too – understanding where everyone is on their learning curve is key.
This led to a key personal learning: my mindset shifted from chasing 'best practice' to embracing 'better practice.' It’s about continuous improvement, finding what works for that specific organisation in their context, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all ideal. It's about progress, not perfection. This is precisely why 'It’s not basic, it’s foundational' is the perfect title – what might seem simple to me could be transformative for an organisation depending on its scale and data maturity.
Early Career Leadership Development
My usual role is heavily technical – deep in the code, building models. But these past six weeks were incredibly strategic and tactical. I wasn't just executing; I was applying strategic thinking, problem-solving at a higher level, and guiding conversations to shape future directions. This was a fantastic opportunity for early career leadership development, pushing me into a more advisory role.
Empowering Leadership: People Over Tools
This secondment reinforced a core belief of mine: while I love data tools and technologies, I care more deeply about people. My role wasn't just to implement software; it was to empower individuals, to build their confidence, and to spark their own curiosity and capability. It’s not about doing the work for them; it’s about igniting that internal 'flame' so they can continue to grow and tackle their own data challenges independently.
Acknowledging the Foundational Nature of the Work
I sometimes feel like I haven't done anything huge, but then I remember: we’re definitely going in the right direction. In six weeks, you don't build a skyscraper. You lay the concrete slab, you dig the footings, you ensure the ground is stable. It might not look 'big' on the surface, but it's absolutely essential for whatever comes next. It’s all about scale and data maturity – what I might consider 'basic' can be genuinely transformative for an organisation at a different stage.

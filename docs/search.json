    "text": "Justifications:\nInitially, I was interested in the spatial distribution of magpies in Canberra as I’m an avid cyclist and wanted to find the hotspots of magpie records and linking/statistically model this data with a collaborative magpie swooping database called magpiealert.com. Unfortunately, the data was not available and the sampling bias of the occurrence data may not be truly representative, as observations are more likely to be near roads, airports, and major urban areas (Kellie, 2022).\nThis made me interested in simply visualising the data spatially, instead of using any statistical methodologies and focusing the project on whether there would be major differences/patterns of occurrence records in urban vs. non-urban/regional areas. Unfortunately, given the scope of the project, calculating the urban vs. non-urban analysis would have been too much scope-creep, so this aim was ignored (maybe post-project exploration).\nHughes et al. (2021) and Guerin et al. (2016) highlight the spatial sampling bias associated with biodiversity data suggesting that these biases must first be understood before applying any statistical modelling methods. Interestingly, Australian research by Piccolo et al. (2020) show that reptile research locations are highly positively correlated with proximity to universities suggesting biodiversity research locations are closely associated by accessibility. Similarly, temporal biases can also influence results, as species distributions can change across time (Boakes et al., 2010).\nThe Atlas of Living Australia already have a browser-based spatial visualisation tool, where a specific species can be selected and plotted on a map. However, there seemed to not be a functionality to comparing both the spatial and temporal (by month) variables.\nThis dashboard is the initial step in data exploration step and in the essence of open and citizen-science, I wanted to make my cleaned data easily available through the dashboard. Data sharing enables for further analysis and reusability (Tedersoo et al., 2021, Ramachandran et al., 2021). I wanted my dashboard to follow the FAIR Data Principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016).\nI chose invasive animal species, because of the rabbits I see when cycling in Canberra. The other 6 species were chosen arbitrarily based off this article, which summarises the results from Kearney et al.’s paper (2018).\nA deeper understanding of my thought process is documented in GitHub Issue #4.\nThe analysis was based on this ALA Labs article (Smith et al., 2023)."

This plot suggests two things:\n\nThe time frequency when citizen scientists submit data and/or when professional/government teams measure/monitor invasive species. Maybe, annual monitoring occurs in May?\nThe actual temporal species distribution. For example, maybe there are more cats in May in SA, because of reproduction behaviour?\n\nLet’s create it for Feral Cats in South Australia (A screenshot was used, see GitHub for code - this blog post is already so long…).\n\n\nTemporal Feral Cats in SA"

With our bikes and gear now all packed in the car, it was time for an early nights sleep.\nThe plan from here would be to drive to Braidwood, then cycle across 4 days back to the car in Moss Vale and then collect the other car in Braidwood and head back to Canberra. The alternatives would have been getting someone to pick us up from Moss Vale or catching the train back to Canberra. Having overestimated our bikepacking speed in the past, the convenience of having our own transportation post-bike leg was very worth the Wednesday evening effort."

    "text": "Day 1: Braidwood to Piercys Clearing\n\nThe Bike Pump…\nToday was the first day where (almost) everything went to plan - unfortunately a rariety in my bikepacking career so far.\nAwake and ready to start the day, we would make our way straight to Braidwood Bakery1. The bikes and bags are now fully setup and we’ve taken our first of many 10 second self-timer photos. Robin wants to quickly pump up his tires before we hit the gravel. To our surprise, I realise that I had forgotten to bring the valve adaptor for our pump2.\n1 Braidwood Bakery is such a local classic for any Canberrans heading to the coast for the weekend.2 Most modern bikes use Presta valves, whereas cars use Schraeder valves, unfortunately, my handpump only had the Schraeder valve. A rookie mistake!In a worried manner, we push our bikes through town asking shopkeepers if they sell any pumps:\n\nThe local outdoor shop … negative\nThe petrol station … negative\nThe local IGA … negative\nThankfully, Braidwood Mitre 10 came in clutch with a full-sized bike pump\n\nWe strap it onto my front handle bars with some spare straps I brought (a reminder to always bring some spare straps!).\n\n\nPumped up, let’s go, off to Nerriga Pub!\nAnd off we go having already problem solved, we jump onto Little River Road leading onto Charleys Forest Road off to Nerriga. The gravel was smooth and slightly undulating. Complimented by a cool misty morning, we were flying past grazing cattle, calm creek crossings, and a peaceful snake enjoying the warm road!\nWith the sun starting to break through the clouds, arriving at Nerriga was a lifesaver from the incoming onslaught of the heat. Excited to down a celebratory pint of Carlton Draught and a pub feed, we were greeted by two confused looking locals joking they would have preferred taking their motorbikes instead of bicycles. I followed with a slight nod and a chuckle, as I gazed over to see another bikepacker enjoying the shade. Not able to wait any longer, I rush inside to see a bustling pub full of elderly people enjoying their meals. I order the pub burger and my pint and head outside curious to hear where the other bikepacker had come from.\nLachie had the full bike setup, a bunch of bike bags, mountain bike cleets, thick tires, and even some tri bars. I knew I was just about to meet an expert in the field. Offering a seat to his table, we had lunch with him finding out he had just come from Gerringong via the same route we had planned - only to realise his final destination was not Braidwood, but in fact Tasmania…. After exchanging stories and advice, Robin and I left for our afternoon session.\n\n\nEndrick River swim\nBack on gravel, we came across Endrick River, a lovely swimming spot by a small shady forde. Perfect timing, plenty of daytime to spare, so a quick dip was so refreshing! Drying off, we’re back on the bikes cycling through Morton National Park overlooking some impressive cliff faces following the Red Ground Track3. After a small mishaps in navigation4, we arrived at Piercy’s Clearing about 100m from a smaller estuary of Endrick River. Another quick rinse off followed by some Backcountry freeze-dried Satay Chicken and some much needed stretching, we were ready for sleep.\n3 Beware this Track is super rocky, like big chunky sharp rocks. I’m surprised we didn’t get a flat!4 Note to self: Always double-check the map, especially after a 35°C day of cycling 🥵\n\nSome night time reflection\nLaying on my mat resting my head against my rolled up sleeping bag. The current sleeping arrangements are a cosy 1-person tent with a luxuriously large Sea to Summit sleeping mat. Planning on using my sleeping bag liner and keeping the bag packed up given the a warm-ish night. I reflect through photos and videos of the day feeling my joints relax and recover after a warm days ride.\nListening to the rustling shoulders against the mat searching for the optimal position, I finally get comfortable and wrap myself in the liner. Immediately, I feel the merino radiating keeping me warm and snug and slowly close my eyes to the whispers of crickets and creaking nocturnal animals in the distance. Hopefully I still have all my food in the morning! Good night 😴"

    "text": "Day 2: Piercy’s Clearing to Nowra\nsweating profusely, and motel magic\nBreakfast is always a struggle! Consistent food intake is so so important when it comes to endurance events. So when I know there’s a long, sunny day ahead, I’ll attempt to eat as much as I can for breakfast and essentially every other meal of the day.\nToday’s planned menu:\n\nBreakfast (at Piercy’s Clearing): Porridge, nutella, salami, hazelnut coffee\nLunch (at Yalwal): Backcountry Moroccan Lamb\nDinner (in Nowra): Pizza, Bundaberg Guava\nDessert (at the motel): Maxibon, chocie milk\nSnacks (constantly): Peanut M&Ms, salted nuts, soya Crisps, Gu gels5, powerade\n\n5 Big fan of the flavourless Nude “flavour”. Strawberry and Banana & Birthday Cake are pretty good too. I prefer thicker gels, so Gu works well for me.\nRocky flats & sandy downhills\nToday’s first few kilometres are met with large rocky sections making a very slow start. I’m surprised we didn’t get any flats as it was very technical riding on our thin gravel tires. We finally made it out of that “hell-ish”6 rocky section to arrive on top of the clouds overlooking the valley we’d just been sleeping in. It’s an awesome feeling looking out into the distance on the cliff tops, feeling a slight breeze on your face surrounded by eucalypts watching the fire trail dance along the ridgeline. This was one of the highlights.\n6 We met another bikepacker racing in the Sydney to Summit race, who greeted us with “welcome to hell”, as he was flowing down the mountain. I think he was in a lot of pain, the kind of pain that is felt once you’re truly past type 2 fun. I think I found his Strava after the trip; he made it to Kosciuszko.7 Going fast is just such a thrill, but wow it’s also just so so dangerous.8 I can’t believe there are some people that opted to do Attack of the Buns the opposite direction and would have to climb up that section, absolutely bonkers.Back into action, we get back onto tarmac for a sweet 75km/h+ speedy descent down Braidwood Road7 shortly after jumping back onto the gravel following Yarramunmun Firetrail. Now we had switched from rocky technicals to the sandy downhills, from one technical to the next. Whilst the downhill was appreciated, the heat reflecting off the white-beige sand radiated for what felt for a few monotonous hours. Thankfully, after an incredibly steep descent8, we finally made it into Yalwal, a camping green space next to one of several dams around the Shoalhaven region. Seeking out shelter from the blistering sun, we spent over 2 hours eating, playing cards, attempting to rehydrate and recover in preparation for a big climb out of the basin. After a backcountry, way too many M&Ms, several chugs of my warm Powerade, we were as ready as could be for the climb.\n\n\nThe Fun Scale - “this is fun, that was fun, that sucked”\nPowering up a mountain is a mental game, a tug of war between pushing through the lactic acid buildup or stopping and catching a break in the shade. The latter is promising, but the ego says otherwise. At some point, the body gets used to the pain, sometimes even reaching the nirvana-state of type 2 fun - miserable in the moment, but awesome in retrospect. Thoughts slowly get filled with echoes of doubt, but also reminders of triumph and motivation9. The grit comes out and you power through sometimes even zoning out or perhaps it’s actually zoning in; into a state of mind where the only objective is “push” and hope you don’t end up in type 3 fun10. Enough talk about the fun scale, back to the day.\n9 There’s definitely a motivation to push through the pain to ensure you maximise your Strava statistics. Anything for the forward-looking expectation of the kudos-induced dopamine hit! ⚡10 Type 1 fun is fun in the moment and in retrospect. Type 2 fun is not fun in the moment, but fun in retrospect (this is probably the most prominent feeling for long-distance runners). Finally, type 3 fun is not fun in the moment and also not fun in retrospect - “it just sucks”.11 Lots of Linkin ParkMaking it up to the top, I see a sun-protected area, whip out my luxury-item - foldable cushioned mats - sit back and enjoy the last drops of my lukewarm powerade. I’m running low on snacks, I’m excited for Nowra. Robin and I enjoy some more shade listening to our nostalgic 2010s (arguably emo/edm phase) music 11, hop on the saddle heading east to Nowra.\n\n\nHow good is Chocie Milk ❤️\nGetting back into a busy town, especially over the summer weekend, was a little bit of a shock. So much stopping and starting. We get into Nowra CBD and I propose to Robbie, that I quickly run into Coles to grab a 2L Oak chocie milk… Best decision. I had about a whole liter within a few minutes.\nGetting to the motel made me really appreciate all the common household services, like a cold shower, a microwave, a bed, an aircon (omg the aircon was immediately turned on upon entering!), a chair and table, fresh drinkable cold water12. What luxuries.\n12 As someone who’s only recently gotten into camping, this must be a common experience to those more experienced, but alas a nice personal appreciation.We finished off the day with some local woodfired pizzas and restocking on snacks at Coles. Returning to the aircon-chilled room and covering up under blankets was a lovely change (can’t believe I appreciated this so much given it was only one night of camping eeeep)."

Interestingly, the shortest track_name has a length of 1 characters. I wonder what song that is.

I wonder if this is because I listen to music on my commute to work? Although, I don’t think I was really working consistently in 2022-23.\nSo potentially this is because I listen to music when I was studying? To answer this question and gain more insights, I would need to look at my calendar and see what I was doing on those days.\nHow did my streaming time vary by day?\nLet’s plot the total hours played per day.\n\nGGPLOT_HOURS_PLAYED_PER_DAY &lt;- STREAMING_HISTORY_PER_DAY |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = streaming_datetime, y = total_hours_played)) +\n  \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  \n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Hours Played Per Day\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 20,\n      face = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    axis.title = element_text(\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    axis.text = element_text(\n      size = 10\n    )\n  )\n\nGGPLOT_HOURS_PLAYED_PER_DAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a high fluctuation in the number of hours played per day with some days, when very little music was played and some days were a lot of music was played. It seems that there are two days in particular, where I have listened to a lot of music. Let’s investigate these days further, we know that the days are: 2023-05-30 and 2023-02-18. What did I do on these two days? Let’s also include a smoothed line.\n\nGGPLOT_HOURS_PLAYED_PER_DAY +\n  \n  geom_point(aes(\n    colour = ifelse(\n      streaming_datetime == as.Date(\"2023-05-30\") | \n        streaming_datetime == as.Date(\"2023-02-18\"),\n      \"red\",\n      \"darkgrey\"\n    )\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_line(colour = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  geom_label(\n    label = \"Flying to Australia\",\n    x = as.Date(\"2023-05-30\"),\n    y = STREAMING_HISTORY_PER_DAY |&gt; \n      filter(streaming_datetime == as.Date(\"2023-05-30\")) |&gt; \n      pull(total_hours_played),\n    vjust = -0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_label(\n    label = \"Flying to Austria\",\n    x = as.Date(\"2023-02-18\"),\n    y = STREAMING_HISTORY_PER_DAY |&gt; \n      filter(streaming_datetime == as.Date(\"2023-02-18\")) |&gt; \n      pull(total_hours_played),\n    vjust = -0.5\n  ) +\n    expand_limits(\n    y = c(0, 20)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_identity()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying in the plane and listening to music! That makes sense. The smoothed line suggests that there was more music listened to in the second half of 2022 than the first half of 2023.\nHow did my streaming time vary by month?\nLet’s investigate this further: what was the total number of hours played per month?\n\nSTREAMING_HISTORY_PER_MONTH &lt;- CLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    month_floor = floor_date(streaming_datetime, unit = \"month\"),\n    year_floor = floor_date(streaming_datetime, unit = \"year\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(month_floor, year_floor) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'month_floor'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nLet’s plot the total hours played per month.\n\nSTREAMING_HISTORY_PER_MONTH |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = month_floor, y = total_hours_played)) +\n  \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  \n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Hours Played Per Month\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 20,\n      face = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    axis.title = element_text(\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    axis.text = element_text(\n      size = 10\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a bit of a pattern. Before I went backpacking (Jan 2023), I was listening to a lot more music. Let’s calculate the total number of hours played in both years and see how different they are.\n\nSTREAMING_HISTORY_PER_MONTH |&gt; \n  group_by(year_floor) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(total_hours_played)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  year_floor total_hours_played\n  &lt;date&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2022-01-01               697.\n2 2023-01-01               481.\n\n\nThere definitely seems like there is a major difference between the two years. I wonder if this is because I was travelling in 2023 and therefore didn’t have as much time to listen to music. Let’s investigate this further.\nWho were my top artists?\nLet’s investigate who my top artists are. We will do this by grouping by artist name and then calculating the total number of hours played.\n\nCLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt; \n  group_by(artist_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_hours_played)) |&gt; \n  head(10) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(artist_name, total_hours_played), y = total_hours_played)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = ifelse(total_hours_played &gt; 20, \"orange\", \"grey\"))) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Top Artists\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History: July 2022 - July 2023\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, I’m a massive Parcels fan and the data shows it! Let’s look at my top artists for each month.\n\nCLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    month_floor = floor_date(streaming_datetime, unit = \"month\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(month_floor, artist_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_hours_played)) |&gt; \n  group_by(month_floor) |&gt; \n  slice(1) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = month_floor, y = total_hours_played, fill = artist_name)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Top Artists Per Month\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History: July 2022 - July 2023\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'month_floor'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, Parcels really was my favourite artist consistently throughout the time range, although from April 2023 onwards, it seems I started listening to more podcasts. A further question for future investigation: How does my podcast listening behaviour change over time.\nWhat were my top songs?\nLet’s move onto top songs. We will do this by grouping by track name and then calculating the total number of hours played.\n\nCLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt; \n  group_by(track_name, artist_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_hours_played)) |&gt; \n  head(10) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(track_name, total_hours_played), y = total_hours_played)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = ifelse(artist_name == \"Parcels\", \"orange\", \"grey\"))) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Top Songs\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History: July 2022 - July 2023\\nOrange = Parcels\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'track_name'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive of the top 10 songs were songs from Parcels.\nLet’s look at the top songs for each month.\n\nCLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    month_floor = floor_date(streaming_datetime, unit = \"month\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(month_floor, track_name, artist_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_hours_played)) |&gt; \n  group_by(month_floor) |&gt; \n  slice(1) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    fill_colour = case_when(\n      track_name == \"Lost in Music - Dimitri from Paris Remix\" ~ \"pink\",\n      artist_name == \"Parcels\" ~ \"orange\",\n      .default = \"grey\"\n      )\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = month_floor, y = total_hours_played, fill = fill_colour)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Top Songs Per Month\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History: July 2022 - July 2023\\nOrange = Parcels\\nPink = Lost in Music - Dimitri from Paris Remix\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'month_floor', 'track_name'. You can\noverride using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that I listened to Lost in Music - Dimitri from Paris Remix a lot in July/August 2022. Parcels was my top artist for every month, but it seems that I listened to them a lot more in October 2022 and January/Febuary 2023.\nHow did my top 10 songs vary across time?\nLet’s investigate how my top 10 songs varied across time. We will do this by grouping by track name and then calculating the total number of hours played.\n\ntop_ten_songs &lt;- CLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt; \n  group_by(track_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_hours_played)) |&gt; \n  head(5) |&gt; \n  pull(track_name)\n\nCLEANED_STREAMING_HISTORY |&gt;\n  filter(track_name %in% top_ten_songs) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    month_floor = floor_date(streaming_datetime, unit = \"month\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(month_floor, track_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours_played = sum(min_played / 60)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = month_floor, y = total_hours_played, colour = track_name)) +\n  \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  \n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Hours Played\",\n    title = \"Top 5 Songs - Hours Played Per Day\",\n    subtitle = \"Spotify Streaming History\",\n    colour = \"Track Name\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 20,\n      face = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    axis.title = element_text(\n      size = 15\n    ),\n    axis.text = element_text(\n      size = 10\n    )\n  )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'month_floor'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is super interesting. It seems that there are some rough patterns in my top 5 songs. For example, “Lost in Music - Dimitri from Paris Remix” was played a lot in the first half of 2022 and then not at all in the first half of 2023. Similarly, “The Girl” has a similar downwards trend. “Tieduprightnow” was played a lot in the new year (2023); however, also dropped. “Free” and “Bitter Sweet Symphony” were almost perfectly positively correlated with each other with the exception of late 2022.\nI wonder if I could do this analysis for all of my songs and then create a grouping/cluster analysis to see if there are any temporal patterns in my music listening? Are there some songs that I listen to with other songs? Do these songs group together because I usually listen to them from the same playlist? Can I somehow link/predict my playlist data and my streaming data?"

    "text": "Moving Forward\nThere are quite a few questions that I would like to explore in the future. For example: - I would like to explore how my podcast listening behaviour change over time. - I would like to explore how my top 10 songs varied across time and utilise the gganimate package. - I would really like to do some time series analysis on my streaming history. - I’m curious on linking my streaming history data with my playlist data. I wonder if I can predict my playlist data based on my streaming history data. I think I would typically use Spotify by listening to my playlists, so potentially doing some clustering/grouping analysis on my streaming history data and then linking it to my playlist data would be interesting.\nThese are all questions that I would like to explore in future! But for now, these were some great first initial data explorations of my Spotify streaming history. I hope you enjoyed reading this post and I hope you learned something new about Spotify streaming history data analysis. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear from you! :)"
